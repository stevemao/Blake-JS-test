## Start

You must have the lastest version of Node.js installed and run the following command in your terminal.

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a webpack-dev-server.

Follow the instruction in the console or just open `http://localhost:8000/` manually.

*Note:* In order to see/change the url, please open in inline mode. The app is using `react-router` so the url is important.

## Unit test

```
npm test
```
