Problem
-------

Company X is developing a new app for student education. Students complete quizzes and their progress is recorded.

Each quiz has 2-4 questions. There are 5 quizzes in total.


Part 1
------

Write a web app that displays the quizzes provided (lessons.json, quizzes.json).

It should have a page to view an individual quiz.


Part 2
------

Allow a student to answer questions in the quizzes and submit an entire quiz once all questions have been answered.


Part 3
------

Students start from Quiz 1 and progress through to Quiz 5. They should only be allowed to access the next quiz (e.g. quiz 2) when they have finished the prior quiz (e.g. quiz 1).


Part 4 (Optional)
-----------------

Add a page to show the student's progress through all the quizzes and their scores for each quiz they have completed.

Please submit your application as a public git repo. Itâ€™d be great to see commits
of how the solution came about. If you have any questions feel free to email
martin.stannard@blake.com.au.


## Start
